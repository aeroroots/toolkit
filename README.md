Hi, we're Roots - the Aeroponics system shaping the future of urban food production with open source technologies. Hence why we have created this detailed guide for you to follow to make your own aeroponics system. We're two designers based at Fab Lab Barcelona, passionate about creating systems for food production which are open-source and accessible.
This is version 1 of our aeroponics system. We're working on further developments of the system, improving energy consumption, materials and nutrients - if you have any questions or advice don't hesitate to [contact us](link to our website with email ).

This system can be implemented in schools, work, makerspaces or at home. It's modular, so it can be adapted to be bigger, or smaller. We encourage you to experiment and contribute further to the open-source community.
