# Toolkit

Hi, we're Roots - the Aeroponics system shaping the future of urban food production with open source technologies. Hence why we have created this detailed guide for you to follow to make your own aeroponics system. We're two designers based at Fab Lab Barcelona, passionate about creating systems for food production which are open-source and accessible.
This is version 1 of our aeroponics system. We're working on further developments of the system, improving energy consumption, materials and nutrients - if you have any questions or advice don't hesitate to [contact us](link to our website with email).

This system can be implemented in schools, work, makerspaces or at home. It's modular, so it can be adapted to be bigger, or smaller. We encourage you to experiment and contribute further to the open-source community.


## Tools and Software

### Tools
- 3D Printer such as Ultimaker or Anycubic - Kossel: available for around 150€ from Aliexpress. (Preferably recycled food safe filament such as Nylon, PET or PP.)
- Circular Saw or Handsaw
- Vacuumtable - Can easily be replicated with a strong vacuum cleaner and a frame ([see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O790OvRy1rc)). The other option is to adapt the design to a pre-made recycled PP box from for example [Whatmoreuk](https://www.whatmoreuk.com/product/wham-bam-36l-h-duty-box-lid-grey-upcycled/)

### Software
- Rhinoceros 3D or any other 3D modelling software you feel comfortable with (i.e. Fusion 360 etc).
- Cura or the required software from your 3D printer.
- Balena etcher to flash the Image on to the RaspberryPi.
- Online: NodeRed → Browser based flow editor for easy coding.
- Online: Grafana → Open source online tool for data visualisation
